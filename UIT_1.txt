Nowadays, the Internet, which has many benefits and some drawbacks, is becoming popular all over the world. For one thing, it can provide a lot of information and some kinds of entertainment for us. Instead of using the traditional media like newspapers, we can use the Internet to surf webs to get information. When you have free time, you can relax by listening to music and play games. Furthermore, through the Internet we not only keep in touch with friends and family but also share opinions or photos with each other. Beside the advantages, it also has some disadvantages. It can make us lazy. We only want to use the Internet to get information instead of thinking independently. In addition, we can waste too much time sitting in front of the computer to read newspapers or play games, which can easily have a negative effect on our eyes. In short, I think the internet will be useful to us if we know to use it effectively.
